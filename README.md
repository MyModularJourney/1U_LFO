# 1U_LFO
1U LFO - low frequency oscillator

My 1U (6hp) adaptation of part of the Erica Synths DIY Modulator circuit. 
I needed some small utility LFO's for modulation. I'm not a big fan of 1U in general, but for this purpose it's very useful.

All credit goes to the awesome team over at Erica Synths. Much love and gratitude for their generosity towards the DIY community! 

For their entire open source DIY range check https://github.com/erica-synths/diy-eurorack
I've built all but one of the modules listed there. All are fun in their own way, but I can highly recommend the Polivoks filter!


Since this is a free DIY project, I'm not going to offer a whole lot of customer support. 
I've built all of them myself and can confirm that they're working as I intended.
