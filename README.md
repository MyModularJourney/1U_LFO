# 1U_LFO
1U LFO - low frequency oscillator

My 1U (6hp) adaptation of part of the Erica Synths DIY Modulator circuit. 
I needed some small utility LFO's for modulation. I'm not a big fan of 1U in general, but for this purpose it's very useful.

All credit goes to the awesome team over at Erica Synths. Much love and gratitude for their generosity towards the DIY community!

I've built all but one of the modules listed there.
